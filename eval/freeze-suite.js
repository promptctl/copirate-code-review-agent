//
// It reimplements no part of a replay: every job is `node eval/run-case.js <case-dir> -n 1 --out <out>`,
// the same instrument, in its own process. [LAW:one-source-of-truth] What this file owns is the
// SCHEDULE — which replays are still missing, and which credential runs each one.
//
// Why it exists: the documented workflow was a bare shell loop, and a suite is ~20 replays over several
// hours against a subscription that walls for hours at a time. The loop had no census (a walled token
// produced empty run dirs that nobody noticed for five days), no way to resume, and no way to spend more
// than one account's quota. [LAW:no-silent-failure]
//
// The plan is LEVEL-FILLING: a job exists for case c at level r iff c has fewer than r completed runs. So
// the suite deepens EVERY case before it deepens any one of them, and a freeze interrupted at level 3
// degrades to a valid N=3 suite (baseline.js demands one common N across cases) instead of a lopsided
// 5/5/5/0 that freezes nothing. Re-running the command resumes by re-taking the census — there is no
// resume flag because there is no resume mode. [LAW:dataflow-not-control-flow]
//
//   node eval/freeze-suite.js -n 5 --out eval/out/freeze-<sha> [--cases a,b,…] [--credentials VAR1,VAR2,…]
//
// It is also the gate's replay step: eval/compare.js spawns this command over the baseline's case set
// (--cases) so a gate run and a freeze are one scheduler, not a serial loop beside a parallel one.
//
// [LAW:effects-at-boundaries] Module load is PURE: only stdlib. Every world-effect (fs, spawn, env reads)
// lives inside main() or a helper it calls, so importing this file for the planner tests touches nothing.

const USAGE = `Replay every golden case N times into one output root, resumably, across one or more credentials.

Usage: node eval/freeze-suite.js [options]

  -n, --repeats <N>        Target completed runs per case (default: 5 — the standing baseline depth).
  --out <dir>              Output root shared by every case (default: eval/out). Re-runs resume into it.
  --cases-dir <dir>        Golden case root (default: eval/cases).
  --cases <a,b,…>          Names of the golden cases to replay (default: every case under --cases-dir).
                           A name no case carries is refused before any spend.
  --job-timeout <minutes>  Deadline for ONE replay (default: 120). A replay past it is killed, process
                           group and all, and recorded as a failure. Set it wide: a deadline that kills
                           an honest replay destroys work, while a late one only wastes a lane.
  --credentials <A,B,…>    Names of env vars holding one credential each. One LANE per name, run
                           concurrently; each lane replays jobs sequentially. Default: a single lane
                           reading the suite provider's own credential input.
  --help                   Show this help.

Every case must pin the same engine — the rule eval/baseline.js enforces on the resulting suite, applied
here before any spend. A failed replay goes back on the queue and its lane moves on, attempting each job
at most once, so a walled credential costs one fast pass and a dead case costs one attempt; the command
exits non-zero naming what is still missing.

//   - A job failing for its own sake (a dead case, one corrupt repo.tar.gz, the stochastic

// Stopping the lane outright on any failure gave the first behaviour and lost the second: under the

// other case, and a reproducible one re-aborted every future run at the same job — the suite could never

// attempted AND no peer is mid-replay — because a peer mid-replay is the only thing that can still put a
// job back. Leaving on the queue alone made the suite's work depend on completion ORDER: two lanes, two
// jobs, lane A succeeds while B is still running, A sees the queue empty and goes; B's job then fails,
// requeues to a lane that has already attempted it, and the job ends the run with one attempt across a
