// zai-coverage-bxa lived exactly here, in glue no unit test could see. Every seam downstream was
// already correct in isolation — buildReviewInput hands a patchless file to the worker as a
// read-in-full target, an off-grid finding partitions as unanchored, and an unanchored finding still
// forces REQUEST_CHANGES — yet runPrReview filtered the changed set on `f.patch` before any of them
// ran, and posted a clean APPROVE on a pull request nothing had opened. Two definitions of
// "reviewable" in two files, the stricter one first. [LAW:single-enforcer]
//
// So these assertions are about what the ORCHESTRATOR does, and they substitute only the run's
// outermost collaborators — the host API, the provider probe, and the engine layer — letting every
// seam between them run for real (transport selection, EXCLUDE_PATTERNS, material construction,
// prompt building, finding partition, review submission). The substitution is by module export and
// must happen BEFORE src/run.js is required: run.js destructures its collaborators at require time,
// so a later assignment would never be seen. node:test gives each file its own process, so the
// patched modules never leak into another suite.

// Read at require time by @actions/github (context.repo) and src/run.js (REVIEWED_REPO_ROOT).
