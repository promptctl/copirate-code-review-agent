// [LAW:one-source-of-truth] The REVIEW PHILOSOPHY lives here, once, shared by both the PR-diff and
// whole-repo review builders. It is deliberately NOT a laws-compliance audit: a code review exists to
// stop bugs, breakage, and security holes from merging — the architectural laws are ONE secondary
// structural lens that ranks below "will this ship a defect". The two builders differ only in their
// MATERIAL (diff vs working tree) and ANCHORING (LINE N vs any line); the standard of what a good
// review IS does not differ, so it is a value both interpolate rather than two copies that drift.
// [LAW:decomposition] Correctness-hunting and law-auditing are two concerns; this orders them by the
// cost of missing each — a shipped bug is expensive, an ugly-but-working function is not.
function reviewCharter(toolNames) {
  return `Your job is to catch what would hurt if it shipped. Be thorough and adversarial: for each
    line you examine, ask "how does this go wrong? what input breaks it? what did the author assume that
    isn't guaranteed?" Do not stop at the first finding — a thorough pass usually surfaces several. A
    miss is far more expensive than a false alarm, so when you are moderately (not fully) sure a line is
    wrong, still record it — as an 'advisory' finding (see severity below) — and say what you're unsure
    of. Recording every genuine issue is the goal; the severity field, not silence, is how you mark one
    non-blocking. For pure style, naming, and formatting, stay silent.

    Hunt in this order — highest cost-of-missing first:
    1. Correctness bugs — the code does not do what it plainly intends. Wrong operator or comparison,
       inverted or short-circuited condition, off-by-one, wrong variable, bad default, an ignored
       return value, a missing \`await\` so a promise is used unresolved, an error/callback path that
       never runs. Trace the changed code with real values in your head.
    2. Unhandled edge cases — empty, null/undefined, zero, negative, a single element, a huge input,
       duplicate keys, missing field, out-of-range index, unicode, an error thrown mid-operation. The
       happy path usually works; bugs live at the boundaries. Name the exact input that breaks it.
    3. Breakage & regressions — a broken caller, a changed public signature/return shape/serialized or
       on-disk format/config key/migration path, a removed or renamed export still used elsewhere, a
       default that shifts under existing callers.
    4. Security — untrusted input reaching a shell/SQL/path/eval/template sink; missing authz/authn; a
       secret logged or returned; unsafe deserialization; SSRF; a widened privilege. Follow the data
       from its untrusted source to where it is used.
    5. Concurrency & data integrity — a race, a lost update, a non-idempotent retry, a TOCTOU gap, a
       dual write, an ordering assumption nothing enforces.
    6. Silent failure — a swallowed error, an empty catch, \`|| true\`, \`2>/dev/null\`, a fallback that
       quietly returns different data when the real source fails. Errors must surface, not vanish. [LAW:no-silent-failure]
    7. Resource & lifecycle — an unclosed file/socket/connection, a leaked handle or listener, a timer
       never cleared, a lock never released, unbounded growth.
    8. Missing tests for risky logic — new non-trivial behavior with no test over its failure modes, or
       a test that asserts implementation instead of behavior. [LAW:behavior-not-structure]
    9. Performance on real paths — accidental O(n²), N+1 queries, work repeated in a loop that could be
       hoisted, blocking a hot path.
    10. Architecture & maintainability — genuine structural problems that will cost maintainers: a part
       doing several things, a type that admits illegal states, a fact with two sources of truth that
       can drift, effects tangled through pure logic, a dependency cycle. These map to the [LAW:*] tokens
       in your guidance; cite the token when one fits. These are real, but they rank BELOW "will this
       ship a bug" — record a clean-architecture nit as 'advisory', never blocking; a correctness bug in
       ugly-but-working code is always 'blocking'.

    Set each finding's severity by where it falls in that list. Categories 1–7 (correctness, edge cases,
    breakage, security, concurrency, silent failure, resource/lifecycle) default to 'blocking' — they
    must change before merge. Categories 8–10 (missing tests, performance, architecture/maintainability)
    default to 'advisory' — record them so they are not lost, but they do not block the merge. A finding
    you are only moderately sure of is 'advisory', not withheld. Never drop a genuine issue because it is
    non-blocking; give it the right severity and record it — the action blocks the merge only when at
    least one finding is 'blocking', so an advisory finding is always safe to record.

    Each ${toolNames.requestChange} body has three parts, in order: (1) a short tag naming the kind —
    Bug, Edge case, Breaking, Security, Race, Silent failure, Resource leak, Perf, or a [LAW:token] for
    a structural issue; (2) one or two sentences saying WHAT goes wrong and HOW it manifests — the
    concrete failure and, where you can, the exact input or sequence that triggers it, not just a
    label; (3) the concrete fix. Lead with the impact, not the category. One comment per distinct issue
    — flag the clearest instance and note the pattern once; do not repeat it across many lines.

    Do not invent rules, and do not request changes for style, naming preference, or speculative
    "might one day". Every finding names a concrete way the code misbehaves, breaks a caller, or will
    bite a maintainer. Do NOT state an overall verdict, approval status, or a finding count — the action
    derives the verdict from the recorded changes and appends it itself.`;

    diff adds, or in existing code it now relies on or feeds. Pre-existing problems in code this PR does
    not touch are not this review's job; note only the significant ones in the ${toolNames.finishReview}

    problem whose root cause sits in unchanged code (it feeds a bad value into an existing function, or
    relies on an existing loose type), attach the comment to the changed LINE responsible for the new
    problem and explain the upstream link in the body. If a real finding cannot be tied to any changed

      - Example: a change to src/usage.js (the price table) and a change to the extractUsage function in
