// ─── PRESETS: the known-good endpoint shapes, and the security boundary ──────────────────────
//
// [LAW:types-are-the-program] A resolved endpoint is three facts and no optional halves:
//   { apiType, baseUrl, credential: { kind, value } }
// Every endpoint has all three. There is no "subscription has no baseUrl" special case — a
// subscription's baseUrl is simply Anthropic's, and a future non-Anthropic subscription names its own.
//
// THE SECURITY INVARIANT THIS TABLE CARRIES. An OAuth/subscription credential is long-lived and
// broadly scoped — its blast radius dwarfs a per-service API key — so it must only ever be sent to
// the host it was minted for. A row expresses that by which base-URL field it has, and the two are
// mutually exclusive by construction:
//
//   baseUrl        PINNED     — no input and no config file can move it. REQUIRED for oauth.
//   defaultBaseUrl OVERRIDABLE — an input or config file may replace it. api-key ONLY.
//
// So a row that pins cannot also offer an override (the field is absent), and a row that offers an
// override cannot carry oauth (assertPresetsSafe below refuses it at module load, and a test asserts
// the same over the table). The consequence is the property that matters: **no misconfiguration can
// point a subscription token at an arbitrary host** — reaching that state requires adding a row here,
// which is a reviewed code change, not a YAML typo. [LAW:no-silent-failure]
