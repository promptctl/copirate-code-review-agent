// The pass's SCHEDULE, derived — the facts that turn per-spawn time into wall-clock time.
//
// [FRAMING:representation] Summed spawn time and elapsed wall time are different numbers, and their
// ratio is the diagnosis: an operator who sees only a total cannot tell a slow model (fix: faster
// engine) from too many waves (fix: raise concurrency) from too many sweeps (fix: lower sweepCap) —
// three causes with opposite remedies. The schedule value recorded by runMultiScopePass carries the
// facts; this module derives everything derivable from them, so the record can never contradict
// itself — wave count is never STORED anywhere, it always falls out of scope count and concurrency.
// [LAW:one-source-of-truth]
//
// The recorded schedule value:
//   { scopeConcurrency, sweepCap, scopeCount, spawns: SpawnRecord[] }
// where each SpawnRecord is a discriminated value, one per engine spawn ATTEMPT:
//   { phase: 'scout',                     outcome, usage }
//   { phase: 'worker', scope, pass,      outcome, usage }
// pass 0 is the review of record; pass 1..N are convergence sweeps. outcome is
// 'completed' (the spawn settled with a result), 'retried' (a transient attempt retried in place —
// its burned time is real and appears as its own record), or 'failed' (the settling attempt failed:
// deadline-killed, retry-exhausted, or non-retryable). usage is the spawn's Usage record — its
// host-stamped span carries the duration — or null when nothing ran (a pre-spawn refusal).
// [LAW:types-are-the-program]

// [LAW:one-source-of-truth] THIS module owns the SpawnRecord shape: the producer (the spawn seam in
// src/multiscope.js) mints every record through spawnRecord below, so a drifted tag or outcome
// fails loudly at the mint, never as a silently-wrong breakdown. [LAW:parse-dont-validate] the
// constructor is the checkpoint: a SpawnRecord exists only by passing it, so everything downstream
// reads the stamp instead of re-checking the shape. [LAW:single-enforcer] the mint is the ONE
// checkpoint for the vocabulary — describeSchedule does not re-validate `outcome` (it carries it
// through without branching); its phase throw is exhaustive DISPATCH, not a second check, because
// phase is the one field the fold branches on.
