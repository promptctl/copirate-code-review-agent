// The adaptive multi-scope review engine, shared by both review modes (PR and whole-repo).
//
// [FRAMING:parts-and-seams] A review IS one shape regardless of material or sink: a SCOUT plans the
// review (one survey spawn that emits a list of scopes), then one WORKER per scope judges it (one
// review spawn each), then the workers' findings + usage AGGREGATE into a single review value. PR and
// repo differ only in two values they already differ on elsewhere — the `material` (what the scout
// surveys and what each worker reviews) and the `sink` (how findings leave). [LAW:one-type-per-behavior]
//
// Adaptivity is the GROUPING, not a counted threshold: the scout groups the change by concern and
// follows the import edges it actually crosses, so a one-concern change yields one scope and a
// many-concern change yields many — the same worker pool runs over a list of length 1 or 20,
// identically. There is no "is it big" branch anywhere. [LAW:dataflow-not-control-flow]
//
// [LAW:no-ambient-temporal-coupling] Retry lives at TWO nested layers, each owned by failover.js so
// this module reimplements no retry timing. Inner: every engine spawn (the scout and each worker) is
// wrapped in retryTransientSpawn, so a single transient blip in one of N concurrent workers is
// absorbed in place — the sibling workers' already-recorded findings are never discarded by re-running
// the whole pass. Outer: the WHOLE pass (scout → workers → aggregate) is still ONE attempt of
// failover.produceReview per config, so a transient that PERSISTS past a spawn's inner retries
// escalates to config-level failover/budget as before. Both layers are fail-loud (a scope is never
// dropped); the run only reds when a transient genuinely survives both. [LAW:no-silent-failure]

// [LAW:types-are-the-program] A scope is the strongest true theorem: a named focus, nothing more.
// There is deliberately NO `kind` discriminator — module scopes and boundary scopes are reviewed by
// the identical worker, so the difference lives entirely in the focus TEXT, never in a branch. The
// scout records each scope through the add_scope collector tool, so scopes arrive as typed,
// schema-validated values (parseScopeValue, in src/review.js) — never parsed from the model's prose.
// [FRAMING:representation] That is why this module no longer extracts a JSON array from text: the
// representation a machine checks (the tool schema) replaced the representation we hoped to recover
// (brackets in free text), and the whole class of prose-parsing bugs went with it.

// [LAW:effects-at-boundaries] Pure: compose the single focus string a worker receives — the scout's
// structural context (when present) plus this scope's name and focus. The material turns it into the
// engine prompt (a PR worker's CONCENTRATE block, a repo worker's scope focus).

// It is imported, never re-implemented, so the pre-anchor merge here and the post-anchor snap-collapse
// in partitionFindings share one key and one severity-merge rule. [LAW:single-enforcer]

// [LAW:effects-at-boundaries] Pure: sum the per-spawn Usage values into one. Token counts always add.
// Cost is uniform by construction — every spawn in a pass runs on ONE config, so all costs share the
// same model and the same availability — so the sum is available iff every spawn's cost is, carrying
// the same unavailable reason otherwise. [LAW:no-silent-failure] no spawn's cost is silently dropped.
