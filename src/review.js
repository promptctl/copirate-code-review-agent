// [FRAMING:representation] The key must be an HONEST representation of "the same recorded finding". A

// on the FULL body, normalized, so byte-for-byte re-records — the real double-record case — still

// of one issue surviving as near-duplicates is noise, not loss — the accepted direction to err.
