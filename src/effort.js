// [FRAMING:parts-and-seams] EffortProfile is the single value answering "how much effort to spend on
// THIS review". Today the levers that set a review's cost are scattered and independently owned —
// scope concurrency was a module constant in multiscope.js, reasoning is a per-config field resolved
// at each adapter, the round cap and diff budget come from action inputs, model tier from the failover
// chain. This module is the ONE owner of the effort representation, so the difficulty (propose) and
// budget (cap) epics constrain a single value here instead of reaching into every knob independently.
// [LAW:single-enforcer] [LAW:no-mode-explosion]
//
// The type carries only the axes it TRULY governs today. [LAW:types-are-the-program] a field that
// nothing derives from would be a false theorem — a knob the profile claims to own while its real
// source is still an input or a per-config value elsewhere. So the profile owns `scopeConcurrency`
// (its consumer, the worker pool, reads it here), `roundCap` (its consumer, the pre-spawn round
// gate in run.js, reads it here), and now `reasoningTier` (its consumer is the reasoning fold at the
// runMultiScope seam — the one place the chain and the effort profile meet — which reconciles the
// profile's proposed tier with each config's own reasoning via `maxTier` before the adapter clamps it
// to the engine's range). It GROWS a field as each remaining knob's consumer is migrated off its
// current source: `readBudget` (today MAX_DIFF_CHARS), `modelTier` (today per-config on the chain).
// Adding a field to a well-formed producer is cheap [LAW:carrying-cost]; adding it before its consumer
// exists is a lie — so `reasoningTier` lands together with its fold consumer (multiscope.js) and its
// price (budget.js estimatedCostUsd), never as an ungoverned placeholder.
//
// [LAW:one-source-of-truth] `reasoningTier` on the profile is the difficulty-PROPOSED RAISE, NOT a
// review's absolute reasoning tier. The absolute per-config baseline stays `config.reasoning` (each
// config in the failover chain can name its own), because the profile is one value per REVIEW while
// reasoning is genuinely per-CONFIG — a single profile field cannot faithfully represent a chain whose
// configs disagree. So the profile carries only the raise, defaulting to `null` = "propose no raise;
// the config's own tier stands", and the fold resolves the effective tier = maxTier(config baseline,
// proposed raise) PER CONFIG. This makes difficulty a monotonic FLOOR (it can lift an under-specified
// config, never lower an explicit one) and keeps a default-profile run byte-identical.
//
// `roundCap` is the profile's first COST-BEARING axis, and that is why it lands first: scopeConcurrency
// is cost-NEUTRAL (parallelism trades runner load for wall time, not spend), so a cost estimate over
// the profile had nothing to vary until now (spike zai-budget-qzm.1). Measured cost is cleanly ADDITIVE
// across rounds, so the cap is a clean linear multiplier — the budget epic's most trustworthy estimate
// axis. The value's meaning is unchanged from MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS: 0 = the "unlimited" sentinel.

// [LAW:one-source-of-truth] The default scope-worker concurrency. Quality is identical at any
// concurrency; this only trades runner load for wall time. It lived as DEFAULT_SCOPE_CONCURRENCY in
// multiscope.js; it is the profile's value now, and the worker pool reads it FROM the profile.

// [LAW:dataflow-not-control-flow] The abstract reasoning-tier ladder, low→high, keyed to an ordinal
// RANK. It is the union of every engine's declared reasoning-effort vocabulary: claude-code exposes
// low..max, codex minimal..xhigh, opencode none. `xhigh` (codex's ceiling) and `max` (claude-code's
// ceiling) are the SAME rung — each engine's maximum — so both rank 4; that is what makes clamping a
// tier to an engine that names its ceiling differently resolve top→top instead of dropping a rung.

// @typedef {{ scopeConcurrency: number, roundCap: number, reasoningTier: (string|null) }} EffortProfile

// [LAW:effects-at-boundaries] Pure. The default profile — its values ARE today's behavior, so a
// default-profile run is byte-identical to the pre-profile engine. An OPTIONS object (not positional
// args) because the profile GROWS axes: each future knob is a new named key, so no call site is
// re-threaded when the shape widens. [LAW:carrying-cost]
//
// `roundCap` is SOURCED, not owned: its production default (action.yml's MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS = "5")
// lives at the action boundary and flows in through run()'s parsed input, so it is not duplicated
// here. [LAW:one-source-of-truth] The fallback is the neutral `0` = "unlimited" sentinel — the honest
// value for "no cap was decided here" (a bare call in a test or an omitted-effort default), never a
// second copy of the production default.
//
// `reasoningTier` defaults to `null` = "propose no raise". It is the difficulty-proposed RAISE, not an
// absolute tier (see the header): a null profile leaves each config's own `config.reasoning` untouched
// at the fold, so a default profile is byte-identical. Only difficultyCandidates ever sets it non-null.

// (e.g. an engine that names its ceiling `max` is not swapped for the abstract `xhigh` of the same rank).
