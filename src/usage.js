// The exclusion is STRUCTURAL, not a rule. The notional figure lives under a DIFFERENT NAME on a
// DIFFERENT arm, so a spend fold has no `usd` to read on a subscription cost and cannot pick it up

// round stays countable — a subscription round is a round whose SPEND is known to be zero, not a
// missing one. An absent cost (no usage at all) is accounted as an unpriced one.
//
// `field` is the record key the figure is written under, and it carries THE SPEND EXCLUSION one

// so even a reader that decoded a record and went looking for `usd` finds nothing on a subscription
// round. Same discipline as the two marker names, applied to the two field names.
//
// THE AUTH KIND IS THIS COLUMN, NOT A FIELD. zai-billing-xl0.3 needs to bucket spend by auth method

// `subscription` from, and only from, an oauth credential, so subscription ⟺ oauth and
