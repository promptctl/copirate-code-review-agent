// this review can afford. No IO — the ledger read (spend so far) and the profile override happen at
// the run() boundary (zai-budget-qzm.5); this module is the pure core between those effects.
// [LAW:effects-at-boundaries] [LAW:dataflow-not-control-flow] the chosen profile is a VALUE selected

//                 deep into the budget. (The ultimate "a review always runs" guarantee is the selection
//                 fallback below — this floor keeps the cap itself sane; the fallback covers the
