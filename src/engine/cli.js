// [LAW:one-type-per-behavior] claude-code and codex are ONE behavior — a CLI agent spawned as a
// subprocess that returns findings out-of-band through the MCP collector. They differ only in
// their spawn primitives (the spec: materializeHome/buildCommand/assertSucceeded/extractUsage/...),
// never in the lifecycle that drives them. This factory holds that single produceReview
// implementation; each engine module supplies its spec.
//
// [FRAMING:parts-and-seams] The adapter contract is lifted to the judgment-vs-transport seam:
// produceReview({config, buildPromptFor, instructionsPath}) -> {summary, findings, usage}. The whole
// MCP-collector dance (createReviewCollector -> materializeHome -> spawn -> readCollectedReview) is a
// PRIVATE detail in here — the registry/run.js contract is produceReview, never the subprocess
// mechanics. A direct-API engine implements produceReview with one HTTPS call and never touches this
// factory. [LAW:carrying-cost]
//
// [LAW:single-enforcer] Instruction-injection guard: the engine spawns with its working directory
// set to a fresh ISOLATED temp dir that is NOT an ancestor of the reviewed repo. Every engine
// discovers project instructions (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/opencode.json) from its cwd — by walking
// UPWARD, and (claude-code) by loading nested CLAUDE.md from subtrees UNDER cwd when it reads files
// there. A scratch cwd outside the repo tree defeats BOTH paths: nothing is found upward, and the
// repo — read only by absolute path, never under cwd — never triggers nested-memory loading. This
// is why the cwd must NOT be the repo's parent (that would put the repo under cwd and re-open the
// nested-memory vector for claude-code). The reviewer's own instructions load from the isolated home
// (HOME/CODEX_HOME/XDG), keyed to env not cwd, so they are untouched. The repo stays readable by
// absolute path (no per-engine read grant needed). [LAW:effects-at-boundaries]
