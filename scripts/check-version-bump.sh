# Enforce the version-bump rule on a PR. [LAW:single-enforcer]
#
# CLAUDE.md states the rule in prose: "Every PR that changes what consumers run
# bumps the version, in that same PR." Prose is folklore — guarded only by human
# discipline, it is exactly what let package.json drift behind the release tag
# and stranded four merged releases. This script is the machine that enforces it,
# so the invariant has a type, not a hope. [LAW:types-are-the-program]
#
# The verdict is a pure function of two facts about the diff vs the base:
#   1. did the change touch the SHIPPED SURFACE (the bundle a consumer runs)?
#   2. did package.json's version change?
# A shipped-surface change with no bump fails loudly [LAW:no-silent-failure]; a
# docs/scripts/workflow-only change needs no bump and passes — mirroring the
# release.sh no-op rule. [LAW:dataflow-not-control-flow]
#
# It does NOT re-check that dist/ matches a fresh build — ci.yml already owns
# that single enforcer; duplicating it here would be a second source. [LAW:single-enforcer]
#
# Usage: scripts/check-version-bump.sh <base-ref>
#   <base-ref> — what to diff against, e.g. origin/main (the PR's base branch).
